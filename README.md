## Credits

The resources used to help develop this application are as follows.

- The [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework was used to create the majority of the page and css styles. This allowed for proper layout and responsiveness required for the page.
- The sticky footer for each page was created utilizing the sticky footer example from [Bootstrap 4 Sticky Footer](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/sticky-footer-navbar/)
- I used [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons for the contact page as well as the skills section.

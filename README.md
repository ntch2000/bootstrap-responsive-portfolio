This project is the baseline of what will be a Career Portfolio webpage for the work done in this course. This webpage will hightlight the skills learned in this bootcamp as well as provide examples of work to prospective employers/visitors.

This page will utilize all the skills learned in the course to showcase my capabilities and will be a page that can be linked to containing any and all information needed to become employer-competitive.
